GitHub Assignment
===========

For our first lab assignment in the module Current Trends in Social Computing we had to analyse and visualise collected social media and social networks in different ways. Our task was to illustrate, using Gephi, a partial directed social network with clear labels that shows at least two coloured clusters with bonding and bridging. This assignment accounted for 5% of our overall grade for this module. For this assignment we used Gephi. The data which we used was from our personal Facebook accounts. Gephi is an interactive data visualization platform for different kinds of networks which runs on Windows and is free to download. 

We started our lab assignment by downloading Gephi to our laptops. Once Gephi was installed and running we used NetVizz to extract data from within our Facebook accounts. I used my personal Facebook network date for visualization. My personal network data looks at my friends and friendship connections on Facebook. I copied and saved my personal page network as a _‘.gdf’_ file on my laptop. To insert my personal network into Gephi I went onto Gephi, selection the _‘New Project’_ option. I opened the saved _‘.gdf’_ file which was my personal network.  Under the _‘layout’_ section I choose a new layout called _‘Force Atlas’_ and selected _‘run’_. You can stop this at any stage. I ran a few of the different layout options to see what they were like. I was happy with my first choice _‘Force Atlas’_ so I kept that option. The clustered layout spread out and changed its form so it now shows clearly different groups which are connected to each other. 

All my nodes were one huge cluster so I went into the _‘filter’_ heading, clicked _‘topology’_ and then clicked degree range. My degree range was showing degrees from _0_ to _198_. I reduced this range and clicked _‘filter’_. The new range was smaller which meant that the nodes were more visual. I clicked on the nodes and dragged them away from each other to make the visual more clear. After doing this I had two clear and separate clusters which represent two groups of my friends. They were both connected by one person. 

I zoomed in on the image which was accessible under the _‘global’_ heading. I then labelled my nodes. To do this I selected the _‘labels’_ heading which was located near to the _‘global’_ heading. I ticked the box which said _‘node’_. Each node in the visual is a friend that I have on Facebook. This label option put the names of my friends on top of each node which represented them. I changed the font and the writing size to make the label clear and more readable. 
At this stage I had two distinct clusters of two different groups of my friends. One was a group of my sister’s best friends and the other group was people from my work. To make these two different groups more visually clear I coloured them. To do this I selected the _‘statistics’_ option, then I selected _‘modularity’_ and ran it. I then selected _‘partition’_, refresh and _‘modularity class’_ from the dropdown box and applied this. This changed the colours of the two clusters. One group was now green in colour while the other one was purple. This means that the people in the group with the same colour have huge modularity between them but not with the people from the different coloured group. 

In my visualisation there is one node that is connected to both of the clusters of nodes. The label on the node tells me that my friend Julie knows someone from that is friends with my sister’s group of friends and also knows someone who is friends with my work group of friends. She is the edge/bridge and the link between the two different clusters. There are some nodes which are on their own and located away from my clusters of nodes. They are labelled Alex and Cathal. These are two boys who I met once on holidays which I became friends on Facebook with. They are on their own and have no bridges, also known as edges, to my other cluster of friends because they do not know any of them as they are from a different country. Their different colour of red shows this. 

When I had completed my visualisation I exported the image by selecting _‘file’_, _‘export’_ and then I saved it as a _PDF file_ on my laptop. I then uploaded this PDF file to Blackboard.
